		  solving of failures in computer systems and software problems.<br> is may major that i was worked more than 15years<p> reliability, we observe that studies in reliability of operating system (OS)<br> software are not abundant. Note that a computer system with highly reliable <br>
		  hardware and applications may not be dependable enough if its OS does not show an equivalent level of reliability. This paper presents an empirical study on the reliability of a commercial off-the-shelf 
		  <br>OS software. We analyzed records of real OS failures<br>collected from different computers and workplace environments. Based on the more frequent OS failures observed<br>we created reliability stochastic models to assess<br> the sensitivity of the OS reliability with respect to these failures. </p></h4>
